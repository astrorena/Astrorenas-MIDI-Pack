here are some Questions and Answers because y'all probably have some

Q: What is a MIDI?

A: well to me it's pretty much the song but you can play it on the piano. FNF cover creators most often use MIDIS to create their covers by either recreating the vocals of a song themself or with the help of other people.

Q: How do I use this in UTAU?

A: Open up UTAU like normal, press F or go to the top left and click on File, then press I or Import, and find the midi in your files. For me, the notes are in japanese but they might be something like ? for you. The voicebanks won't read those notes, instead you'll have to rename those notes yourself. I usually just double click on the notes and rename them to the vowels that I think the character will sing.
